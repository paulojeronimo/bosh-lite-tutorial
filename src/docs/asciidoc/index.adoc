Here I show you my steps to put {uri-cloudfoundry}[Cloud Foundry] running on my MacBook Pro through {uri-bosh-lite}[Bosh Lite].
My intention is to prepare an environment to deploy some {uri-cloudfoundry-uaa}[UAA] labs that I'll write in a nearby future.
I'm not detailing concepts, writing extensive comments or explaining each command at this moment.
I just show you the command and its output.
So, *if you want details read the references for each topic*.

WARNING: This is a work in progress.

== Prerequisites

The prerequisites are listed in this page: http://bosh.io/docs/quick-start/#prerequisites.

.Some details relative to my macOS environment:
[NOTE]
====

* All my commands in this tutorial where did on a https://support.apple.com/kb/SP749?locale=en_US[MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016)] with 16 GB of memory, 2.7 GHz quad-core processor.
* I use {uri-homebrew}[Homebrew] to install packages on my mac.
I have details about how I use and install Homebrew in my environment https://github.com/paulojeronimo/dicas-osx/blob/master/homebrew.md[in this page _(pt-br)_].
* I use Bash version 4 on my macOS:
+
----
$ echo $BASH_VERSION
4.4.23(1)-release
----
+
Details about why and how to install this version of Bash can be found http://clubmate.fi/upgrade-to-bash-4-in-mac-os-x/[in this post].
To resume, the following commands does the upgrade:
+
----
brew update && brew install bash && sudo bash -c 'echo /usr/local/bin/bash >> /etc/shells' && chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash
----
* I prefer to use the GNU version of `sed` to make my scripts compatible with Linux environments.
To do this you can https://stackoverflow.com/a/34815955[see this question on Stack Overflow].
To resume, the following commands does this change:
+
----
brew install gnu-sed --with-default-names
----
* The `VirtualBox` version on my machine is shown in the output of the following command:
+
----
$ VBoxManage --version
5.2.12r122591
----
* The http://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2-install/#macos[additional dependencies necessary to run bosh-cli] are installed.
====

Install bosh-cli using Homebrew:

----
brew install cloudfoundry/tap/bosh-cli
----

Check your bosh version:

----
$ bosh -v
version 4.0.1-a18c7230-2018-05-23T23:11:20Z

Succeeded

== Install

NOTE: If you are trying to reinstalling the environment first execute the steps in <<uninstall>>.

Recreate (if existent) `~/bosh-env/virtualbox` and change your current dir to it:

----
rm -rf ~/bosh-env && mkdir -p $_/virtualbox && cd $_
----

Clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment[bosh-deployment] repo:

----
git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment.git
----

Call `create-env.sh`:

----
./bosh-deployment/virtualbox/create-env.sh
----

Output _(on my machine)_: link:output.1.txt[].

Read `.envrc` variables to your current shell:

----
source .envrc
----

Configure bosh to use `vbox` environment:

----
bosh -e vbox env
----

Output _(on my machine)_: link:output.8.txt[]

== Stemcell upload

Upload a stemcell:

----
bosh -e vbox upload-stemcell https://bosh.io/d/stemcells/bosh-warden-boshlite-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent?v=3586.23 --sha1 11e6461b4aca491e28a90686fe9c92dda03d9dc2
----

Output _(on my machine)_: link:output.6.txt[].

WARNING: The version specified on the above command usually are updated in `bosh-deployment` https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment/commit/4464f6dd836f41d2b9e02c26c599ee869d9aaa82[like in this commit].
So, pay attention if you are having problems in future executions of this tutorial.

[[cloudfoundry-deploy]]
== Cloud Foundry Deploy

----
git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment
cd cf-deployment
----

When I was updating this tutorial the version of stemcell used had not yet been updated to `3586.23` on `cf-deployment.yml`.
So, the next command does this change:

----
sed -i 's/3586.16/3586.23/g' cf-deployment.yml
----

----
bosh -e vbox update-cloud-config iaas-support/bosh-lite/cloud-config.yml
----

Output _(on my machine)_: link:output.5.txt[]

----
bosh -e vbox -d cf deploy cf-deployment.yml \
  -o operations/bosh-lite.yml \
  --vars-store deployment-vars.yml \
  -v system_domain=bosh-lite.com
----

Output _(on my machine)_: link:output.4.txt[]

WARNING: As you can see in this output, this is the most time-consuming command in this tutorial.
_(1 hour and 35 minutes on my machine)_.
This is because many downloads and compilation tasks will be executed.
[red]#This command can possibly crash# _(this happened o few times on my machine)_.
In that case, I just re-executed the command.

== Logging into the CF API

Add the following route so you will be able to reach the CF API and also bosh ssh to the instances you deployed:

----
sudo route add -net 10.244.0.0/16 192.168.50.6
----

[NOTE]
====
To execute the next commands, we need `cf-cli` installed.
The references in the previously topic explain this.
But, to resume, the `cf-cli` can be installed by typing this two command lines:

----
brew tap cloudfoundry/tap
brew install cf-cli
----
====

----
$ cf api https://api.bosh-lite.com --skip-ssl-validation

----

----
$ cf target -o "paulojeronimo-org" -s "paulojeronimo-dev"

== Deploy a sample app

----
$ cd ~/bosh-env
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/spring-music
$ cd spring-music
$ ./gradlew assemble

----
cf push --hostname spring-music

Output _(on my machine)_: link:output.7.txt[]

Open the URL of the application. In my case _(seeing the last output)_ this is the URL: http://spring-music-brash-genet.bosh-lite.com.

[[start-stop]]
== Start/Stop

Stop cf vm instances:

----
bosh -e vbox -d cf stop --hard

----
bosh -e vbox -d cf start
----

Output _(on my machine)_: link:output.f.txt[]

NOTE: The above commands stop bosh vms only. To start/stop bosh lite, you need to follow https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment/issues/82[this steps].

[[uninstall]]
== Uninstall

This will remove the created VMs from Virtualbox:

----
cd ~/bosh-env/virtualbox
./bosh-deployment/virtualbox/delete-env.sh
----

Output _(on my machine)_: link:uninstall.1.txt[].

Bosh consumes a lot of disk space:

----
$ du -hsc ~/.bosh
4.7G	/Users/pj/.bosh
4.7G	total
----

----
$ du -hsc ~/.bosh_virtualbox_cpi
 24G	/Users/pj/.bosh_virtualbox_cpi
 24G	total
----

So, if you don't mind to download all that is already downloaded/created, you can also type this commands:

----
rm -rf ~/.bosh ~/.bosh_virtualbox_cpi
----
